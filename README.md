My name is Jon,

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my master thesis while furthering my bioinformatic skills to broaden my genetic data knowledge and capabilities. In the meantime, I'm finishing a homebrew package containing functions to speed up the analysis of microbiome data which I have used in my thesis. Afterwards, I plan on  furthering my bioinformatic skills to broaden my genetic data knowledge and capabilities touching on RNA-seq, epigenomics, variants, big data...
